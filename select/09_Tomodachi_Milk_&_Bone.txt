I'll never be with you
You'll never take my hand
You'll never say you like me
I'll never be your friend
This is where the story begins
Same place it ends, we will never be friends
Friend request sent, ignore, tell 'em again
Clean sweep to the memory gland, peace
Yet still she give chase and I'm sick of it
You illiterate, son of a little bit
Bare naked lady, she love my limp bizkit
But I don't wanna be the father of an illegitimate
You should be the partner of another
Find another brother, be your friend, be your lover
'Cause you be tryna argue, shut up
I don't really wanna, save the drama for your mama
I ain't wit it
I ain't wit it
Different place, different time but still I ain't wit it
You don't get I
You don't get it
We ain't never gon' kick it, nah
And now you're just somebody that I used to know
You can't be my buddy, I ain't music soul
Child, drive me wild, oh my damn
Yeah, I will never be your friend
